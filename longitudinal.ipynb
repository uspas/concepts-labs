The second section walks through a particle-in-cell example simulation in Elegant via Sirepo.

    "However, you will observe that Sx looks slightly different from the case without a dipole. There is a small de-focusing kick at the entrance of the dipole, and a small focusing kick at the exit of the dipole. These two kicks cancel, and the periodic solution in the horizontal plane is almost identical to the FODO cell without a dipole. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the average value of Sy has decreased significantly, and there is a focusing kick at the entrance and exit. The dipole has a net focusing effect in the vertical plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for these differences is an effect called *edge focusing*, which is caused by fringe fields that extend past the edge of the dipole. An exploration of edge focusing is beyond the scope of this lab, but it is good to be aware that this is another way in which dipoles affect the lattice and beam parameters. Edge focusing is an effect which does not depend on beam energy spread. In contrast, the strength of the effects caused by dispersion and chromaticity do depend on energy spread in the particle distribution - which is mainly determined by the RF system used for acceleration.\n",
